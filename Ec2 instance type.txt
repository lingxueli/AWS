EC2 instance type

General purpose: a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources

Compute optimized instances: high-performance processors. ideal for high-performance web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers. You can also use compute optimized instances for batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.

Memory optimized instances: fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. ideal for workload that requires large amounts of data to be preloaded before running an application, performing real-time processing of a large amount of unstructured data

Accelerated computing instances: use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. ideal for floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching; graphics applications, game streaming, and application streaming.

Storage optimized instances: high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage
